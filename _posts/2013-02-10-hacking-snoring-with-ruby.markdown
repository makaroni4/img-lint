So the question I asked myself recently – do I snore? Actually the things were a lil bit different – once in the morning I had to accept the fact that "Man, you snore!".

### Run-up

Was it that bad? Honestly I was afraid to ask that kind of question so I decided to record the sound of my sleep and find the sound of snoring. Right before going to bed I turned on voice memos and put the iphone next to my pillow.

### In the morning

In the morning I had 1.5Gb .wav file (5 hours of sleep) to analyze.
